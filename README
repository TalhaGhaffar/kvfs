In-kernel key-value storage system prototype
LKP Project 06
---------------

The "kernel" folder contains all kernel code, in the form of a module. That 
code can be divided into two parts: the module core functions (in "core.h"
and "core.h") containing the storage system initialization and exit functions,
as well as the implementation of the storage system algorithms. In "device.c"
and "device.h", the code related to the virtual device management is located.

The "user" folder contains all userspace related code. "kvlib.c" and "kvlib.h"
are the sources of the library with wich you must compile the program that 
needs to access the storage system. "testbench.c" is an example of such a 
program containing a set of test cases.
